RF Powermeter based on a [Analog Devices ADL5902](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADL5902.pdf)

I used following parts:
* [ADL5902 PCB from Aliexpress](www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005379026897.html)
* [0.96" iÂ²C Oled](www.aliexpress.com/item/32957309383.html)
* [LGT8F328P based Adruino Nano](www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005216975059.html)
* [30db Attenuator 2W](www.aliexpress.com/item/4000086272989.html)

There is still a menu missing that can be used to select the intercept & slope that matches the frequency.
